# Clerk Catch-All Routes Fix

## ✅ Changes Made

I've fixed the Clerk routing error by converting the sign-in and sign-up routes to catch-all routes as required by Clerk in Next.js App Router.

### **Directory Structure Changes:**

**Before:**
```
src/app/
  ├── sign-in/
  │   └── page.tsx
  └── sign-up/
      └── page.tsx
```

**After:**
```
src/app/
  ├── sign-in/
  │   └── [[...sign-in]]/
  │       └── page.tsx
  └── sign-up/
      └── [[...sign-up]]/
          └── page.tsx
```

### **Middleware Update:**

Updated the public routes to include all sub-routes:
```typescript
const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  "/", 
  "/sign-in(.*)",  // Matches /sign-in and all sub-routes
  "/sign-up(.*)",  // Matches /sign-up and all sub-routes
  "/landing"
]);
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart your development server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C) and restart
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Or open in an incognito/private window

3. **Test the sign-in flow:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/sign-in
   - The Clerk component should now work correctly

## 🔍 What This Fixes

- ✅ Clerk can now handle multi-step authentication flows
- ✅ Sign-in/sign-up redirects work properly
- ✅ OAuth and magic link flows are supported
- ✅ No more 404 errors on authentication sub-routes

## 📝 Why This Was Needed

Clerk uses dynamic routes for features like:
- Multi-factor authentication (`/sign-in/factor-one`, `/sign-in/factor-two`)
- OAuth callbacks (`/sign-in/sso-callback`)
- Email verification flows
- Password reset flows

The catch-all route pattern `[[...param]]` allows Clerk to handle all these sub-routes dynamically.

## 🧪 Testing with Playwright

Now that authentication routes are fixed, you can test with Playwright:

```bash
# Run the smoke test
npm run test:smoke

# Or test authentication specifically
npx playwright test auth.setup.ts --headed
```

The authentication flow should now work correctly!
