Task 6: Define Convex Database Schema for Utilities
Status: COMPLETED
Date Completed: December 2024

## Summary
Successfully designed and implemented the database schema for utility management, including comprehensive CRUD operations and efficient querying capabilities.

## Completed Features

### 1. Enhanced Utility Table Schema
Updated the utilities table in `convex/schema.ts` with the following fields:
- userId (string) - Clerk user ID for authentication
- propertyId (v.id("properties")) - Link to property
- name (string) - Utility name (e.g., Electricity, Water, Gas, Internet)
- provider (string) - Utility provider company
- cost (number) - Monthly cost
- billingCycle (optional string) - e.g., "monthly", "quarterly"
- startDate (optional string) - Service start date
- endDate (optional string) - Service end date (if terminated)
- notes (optional string) - Additional notes
- createdAt (string) - Record creation timestamp
- updatedAt (optional string) - Last update timestamp

Note: Per user request, removed accountNumber and status fields from the original design.

### 2. Database Indexes
Implemented efficient indexes for optimized querying:
- `by_property` - Index on propertyId for fast property-based lookups
- `by_user` - Index on userId for user-specific queries

### 3. Query Functions Implemented
Created comprehensive query functions in `convex/utilities.ts`:
- `getUtility` - Retrieve a single utility by ID
- `getUtilities` - Get all utilities for a user (with optional property filter)
- `getUtilitiesByProperty` - Get utilities for a specific property
- `getAllUtilities` - Get all utilities with pagination support
- `getUtilityStats` - Get aggregated statistics for utilities

### 4. Mutation Functions Implemented
Developed complete CRUD operations:
- `addUtility` - Create new utility with duplicate checking
- `updateUtility` - Update existing utility with authorization
- `deleteUtility` - Remove utility with security checks

### 5. Security Features
- User authorization checks on all operations
- Property ownership verification
- Duplicate utility prevention (same name/provider per property)
- Secure filtering by userId

### 6. Additional Features
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Statistics aggregation by type and property
- Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- Automatic timestamp management

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. `/convex/schema.ts` - Enhanced utilities table definition with indexes
2. `/convex/utilities.ts` - Complete rewrite with all CRUD operations

### Key Design Decisions:
- Removed accountNumber field for simplicity
- Removed status field per user feedback
- Added indexes for performance optimization
- Implemented duplicate checking to prevent data issues
- Added comprehensive statistics function for dashboard integration

## Testing Considerations
- All functions include authorization checks
- Error handling for invalid property IDs
- Duplicate utility prevention
- Pagination handling for large datasets
- Security filtering ensures users only see their own data

## Integration Points
- Ready for use in Utilities Page (Task 7)
- Statistics function integrates with Dashboard
- Property association enables property-specific utility management
- All functions follow Convex best practices for performance

## Notes
- The schema is flexible and can be extended with additional fields if needed
- All timestamps use ISO string format for consistency
- The implementation follows TypeScript best practices with full type safety
