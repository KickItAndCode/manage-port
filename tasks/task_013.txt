# Task ID: 13
# Title: Document Future Enhancements for Properties and Utilities Pages
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive document outlining future enhancements for the Properties and Utilities pages, including detailed specifications for each feature.
# Details:
This task involves creating detailed documentation for planned future enhancements to both the Properties and Utilities pages. The documentation should serve as a roadmap for future development sprints.

For the Properties Page enhancements:
1. Property Details Page: Document the UI/UX design and data requirements for a dedicated page showing comprehensive property information, related utilities, leases, and activity history.
2. Search & Filter: Specify the implementation details for search functionality by name, address, and type, along with filters for status, type, and rent range.
3. Sorting: Define the sorting mechanisms for rent, bedrooms, status, and purchase date.
4. Bulk Actions: Detail the UI and backend requirements for selecting and performing actions on multiple properties.
5. Property Images Gallery: Specify the storage requirements, UI components, and user flow for managing multiple property images.
6. Map Integration: Research and document potential map APIs (Google Maps, Mapbox, etc.), integration points, and implementation approach.
7. Export/Import: Define file formats, data mapping, and validation rules for importing/exporting property data.
8. Notes & Attachments: Document the data structure, storage requirements, and UI for property notes and document attachments.
9. Activity Log: Specify the events to track, data structure, and display format for the activity history.
10. Custom Fields: Design the schema flexibility, UI, and validation rules for user-defined custom fields.

For the Utilities Page enhancements:
1. Utility History & Trends: Document the data structure, charting libraries, and algorithms for trend analysis and spike detection.
2. Filter by Property: Specify the UI and data filtering mechanism for the property dropdown.
3. Status Indicators: Define the visual design and status logic for utility status badges.
4. Reminders & Alerts: Document the notification system, scheduling mechanism, and user preferences for utility alerts.
5. Provider Contact Info: Specify the data structure and UI for storing and displaying utility provider information.
6. Utility Documents: Detail the document management system, storage requirements, and UI for utility-related documents.
7. Bulk Add/Edit: Define the UI flow and backend operations for managing multiple utilities simultaneously.
8. Recurring Costs: Document the data structure and calculation logic for tracking recurring utility costs.
9. Notes & Comments: Specify the UI and data structure for utility-specific notes.
10. Export Utilities Data: Define the export formats, data mapping, and user flow for exporting utility data.

For each enhancement, the documentation should include:
- Feature description and user benefits
- UI/UX mockups or wireframes
- Data requirements and schema changes
- Implementation complexity estimate (Low/Medium/High)
- Potential third-party dependencies
- Technical considerations and challenges

The final document should be organized in a structured format with clear sections for each feature category, making it easy for developers to understand and implement in future sprints.

# Test Strategy:
The documentation will be considered complete and accurate when:

1. Review Process:
   - Product manager has reviewed and confirmed all feature descriptions match the intended functionality
   - UI/UX designer has reviewed and approved all interface-related specifications
   - Lead developer has reviewed and confirmed technical feasibility of all proposed enhancements
   - Database administrator has reviewed and approved all data structure changes

2. Verification Checklist:
   - Each feature has complete documentation covering all required aspects (description, UI/UX, data requirements, etc.)
   - All dependencies between features are clearly identified
   - Implementation complexity estimates are provided for each feature
   - Technical challenges and considerations are documented for each feature
   - Third-party integration requirements are researched and documented
   - Storage requirements for images and documents are specified
   - Performance implications of new features are addressed

3. Documentation Quality:
   - Document is well-structured with clear sections and subsections
   - All mockups/wireframes are clearly labeled and referenced in the text
   - Technical terminology is consistent throughout the document
   - Document includes a glossary of terms if necessary
   - Document includes a table of contents for easy navigation

4. Stakeholder Approval:
   - Final document is presented to stakeholders in a review meeting
   - Feedback is collected and incorporated into the final version
   - Document is approved by product owner, development lead, and UX designer

The final deliverable should be stored in the project repository and linked in relevant project management tools for future reference.
