# Task ID: 8
# Title: Define Convex Database Schema for Leases
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement the database schema for lease management.
# Details:
Define Convex tables for leases (id, propertyId, startDate, endDate, tenant, etc.). Link leases to properties via propertyId. Implement CRUD operations using Convex functions.

# Test Strategy:
Test CRUD operations for leases. Verify data integrity and schema validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Identify Lease Management Data Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Gather and specify all necessary fields and relationships for the lease management schema, including required attributes for leases and their linkage to properties.
### Details:
List all fields such as id, propertyId, startDate, endDate, tenant, and any additional metadata needed for lease records. Define how leases relate to properties and tenants.

## 2. Define Convex Database Schema for Leases and Properties [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement the Convex schema for leases and properties using defineTable and appropriate validators, ensuring correct field types and relationships.
### Details:
Write the schema in schema.ts using Convex's defineSchema and defineTable functions. Include all identified fields and set up propertyId as a foreign key reference.

## 3. Implement CRUD Operations for Leases [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Develop Convex functions to create, read, update, and delete lease records, ensuring proper linkage to properties via propertyId.
### Details:
Write Convex mutation and query functions for all CRUD operations on the leases table, handling propertyId references and data validation.

## 4. Establish Indexes and Optimize Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create necessary indexes on lease and property tables to optimize query performance, especially for lookups by propertyId and tenant.
### Details:
Define indexes in the schema for efficient querying, following Convex best practices to avoid redundant indexes and ensure scalability.

## 5. Test and Validate End-to-End Lease Management Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Perform integration testing of the entire lease management system, from schema to CRUD operations, ensuring data integrity and correct property linkage.
### Details:
Simulate real-world lease management scenarios, including lease creation, updates, deletions, and property associations. Check for data consistency and system robustness.
