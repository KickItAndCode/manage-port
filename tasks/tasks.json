Property Details Page: Document the UI/UX design and data requirements for a dedicated page showing comprehensive property information, related utilities, leases, and activity history.\n2. Search & Filter: Specify the implementation details for search functionality by name, address, and type, along with filters for status, type, and rent range.\n3. Sorting: Define the sorting mechanisms for rent, bedrooms, status, and purchase date.\n4. Bulk Actions: Detail the UI and backend requirements for selecting and performing actions on multiple properties.\n5. Property Images Gallery: Specify the storage requirements, UI components, and user flow for managing multiple property images.\n6. Map Integration: Research and document potential map APIs (Google Maps, Mapbox, etc.), integration points, and implementation approach.\n7. Export/Import: Define file formats, data mapping, and validation rules for importing/exporting property data.\n8. Notes & Attachments: Document the data structure, storage requirements, and UI for property notes and document attachments.\n9. Activity Log: Specify the events to track, data structure, and display format for the activity history.\n10. Custom Fields: Design the schema flexibility, UI, and validation rules for user-defined custom fields.\n\nFor the Utilities Page enhancements:\n1. Utility History & Trends: Document the data structure, charting libraries, and algorithms for trend analysis and spike detection.\n2. Filter by Property: Specify the UI and data filtering mechanism for the property dropdown.\n3. Status Indicators: Define the visual design and status logic for utility status badges.\n4. Reminders & Alerts: Document the notification system, scheduling mechanism, and user preferences for utility alerts.\n5. Provider Contact Info: Specify the data structure and UI for storing and displaying utility provider information.\n6. Utility Documents: Detail the document management system, storage requirements, and UI for utility-related documents.\n7. Bulk Add/Edit: Define the UI flow and backend operations for managing multiple utilities simultaneously.\n8. Recurring Costs: Document the data structure and calculation logic for tracking recurring utility costs.\n9. Notes & Comments: Specify the UI and data structure for utility-specific notes.\n10. Export Utilities Data: Define the export formats, data mapping, and user flow for exporting utility data.\n\nFor each enhancement, the documentation should include:\n- Feature description and user benefits\n- UI/UX mockups or wireframes\n- Data requirements and schema changes\n- Implementation complexity estimate (Low/Medium/High)\n- Potential third-party dependencies\n- Technical considerations and challenges\n\nThe final document should be organized in a structured format with clear sections for each feature category, making it easy for developers to understand and implement in future sprints.",
      "testStrategy": "The documentation will be considered complete and accurate when:\n\n1. Review Process:\n   - Product manager has reviewed and confirmed all feature descriptions match the intended functionality\n   - UI/UX designer has reviewed and approved all interface-related specifications\n   - Lead developer has reviewed and confirmed technical feasibility of all proposed enhancements\n   - Database administrator has reviewed and approved all data structure changes\n\n2. Verification Checklist:\n   - Each feature has complete documentation covering all required aspects (description, UI/UX, data requirements, etc.)\n   - All dependencies between features are clearly identified\n   - Implementation complexity estimates are provided for each feature\n   - Technical challenges and considerations are documented for each feature\n   - Third-party integration requirements are researched and documented\n   - Storage requirements for images and documents are specified\n   - Performance implications of new features are addressed\n\n3. Documentation Quality:\n   - Document is well-structured with clear sections and subsections\n   - All mockups/wireframes are clearly labeled and referenced in the text\n   - Technical terminology is consistent throughout the document\n   - Document includes a glossary of terms if necessary\n   - Document includes a table of contents for easy navigation\n\n4. Stakeholder Approval:\n   - Final document is presented to stakeholders in a review meeting\n   - Feedback is collected and incorporated into the final version\n   - Document is approved by product owner, development lead, and UX designer\n\nThe final deliverable should be stored in the project repository and linked in relevant project management tools for future reference.",
