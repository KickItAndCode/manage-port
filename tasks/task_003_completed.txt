Task 3: Design and Implement Dashboard UI
Status: COMPLETED
Date Completed: December 2024

## Summary
Successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive dashboard for the real estate portfolio management system. The dashboard provides real-time insights into property portfolio performance with modern, interactive visualizations.

## Completed Features

### 1. Dashboard Layout and Structure
- Created modern, responsive dashboard page at `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Implemented card-based layout for metrics and visualizations
- Used consistent design patterns with existing application UI

### 2. Key Metrics Display
- Total Properties count
- Monthly Revenue (sum of all property rents)
- Occupancy Rate (percentage of properties with active leases)
- Active Leases count
- Total Square Feet
- Net Monthly Income (revenue minus utility costs)

### 3. Data Visualizations
Implemented interactive charts using Recharts library:
- **Monthly Revenue Trend**: Line chart showing income over the last 6 months
- **Properties by Type**: Pie chart breaking down property types with percentages
- **Properties by Status**: Bar chart showing Available vs Occupied properties
- **Financial Summary**: Visual breakdown of income, costs, and net income

### 4. Recent Properties Table
- Displays the 5 most recently added properties
- Shows property name, address, type, status, and monthly rent
- Color-coded status badges for visual clarity

### 5. Real-time Data Integration
- Created `convex/dashboard.ts` with comprehensive metrics calculations
- All data fetched from Convex database (no mock data)
- Integrated with existing properties, leases, and utilities queries
- Automatic updates when data changes

### 6. User Experience Enhancements
- Automatic redirect from home page to dashboard for authenticated users
- Loading states with consistent loading component
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Professional color scheme with meaningful color coding
- Icons for visual clarity and improved UX

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created/Modified:
1. `/convex/dashboard.ts` - Dashboard metrics query function
2. `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard page component
3. `/src/app/page.tsx` - Updated to redirect authenticated users to dashboard
4. `package.json` - Added recharts dependency for charts

### Dependencies Added:
- recharts@2.15.3 - For creating interactive charts and graphs

## Testing Performed
- Verified all metrics calculate correctly from real data
- Tested responsive design on multiple screen sizes
- Confirmed real-time updates when properties/leases are added
- Validated chart interactions and tooltips
- Tested loading states and error handling

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add date range filters for historical data
- Implement export functionality for charts
- Add more detailed drill-down views
- Include maintenance tracking metrics
- Add customizable dashboard widgets

## Notes
- Dashboard is fully integrated with existing authentication system
- All data is user-specific (filtered by userId)
- Performance optimized with single query for all metrics
- Follows existing design patterns and component library usage
