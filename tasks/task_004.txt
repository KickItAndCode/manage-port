# Task ID: 4
# Title: Define Convex Database Schema for Properties
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement the database schema for property management.
# Details:
Define Convex tables for properties (id, name, address, rent, etc.). Implement CRUD operations using Convex functions. Use TypeScript for type safety. Store property data in Convex.

# Test Strategy:
Test CRUD operations for properties. Verify data integrity and schema validation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Property Table Schema in Convex [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the Convex table schema for properties, specifying fields such as id, name, address, rent, and other relevant attributes using TypeScript for type safety.
### Details:
Create or update the schema.ts file in the convex/ directory. Use defineTable and appropriate validators to specify property fields. Ensure TypeScript types are enforced for all fields.

## 2. Implement Property Table in Convex Database [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Deploy the defined property table schema to the Convex database to enable storage and retrieval of property data.
### Details:
Apply the schema to the Convex backend, ensuring the property table is created and accessible. Use the Convex dashboard or CLI to verify table creation.

## 3. Develop CRUD Functions for Properties [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement Convex functions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the property table, ensuring all interactions are type-safe.
### Details:
Write serverless functions in the convex/ directory for each CRUD operation. Use TypeScript types generated from the schema for input validation and type safety.

## 4. Integrate CRUD Functions with Frontend [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Connect the frontend application to the Convex CRUD functions, enabling property data management through the user interface.
### Details:
Use Convex client libraries to call CRUD functions from the frontend. Ensure TypeScript types are used for all data interactions.

## 5. Validate and Document Property Management Workflow [done]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Test the complete property management workflow and document the schema, API, and usage instructions for future reference.
### Details:
Conduct comprehensive testing of all CRUD operations and document the schema structure, API endpoints, and example usage in project documentation.
