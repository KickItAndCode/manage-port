# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Data Validation and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add robust data validation and error handling throughout the application.
# Details:
Implement client-side and server-side validation for all forms. Add error boundaries and user feedback for failed operations. Use Zod for schema validation if needed. Handle Convex and Clerk errors gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Test invalid data submission. Verify error messages and graceful failure handling.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Client-Side Form Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add comprehensive client-side validation for all forms to ensure user input meets required formats and constraints before submission.
### Details:
Use validation libraries such as Zod to define and enforce schema rules on the client. Provide immediate feedback to users for invalid inputs to reduce server load and improve user experience.

## 2. Implement Server-Side Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Add robust server-side validation for all incoming data to ensure security and data integrity.
### Details:
Use Zod or similar schema validation libraries on the server to validate all incoming requests. Ensure that invalid data is rejected with clear, structured error messages specifying which fields failed validation.

## 3. Add Error Boundaries and User Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement error boundaries in the UI and provide user-friendly feedback for failed operations.
### Details:
Wrap critical UI components with error boundaries to catch rendering errors. Display clear, actionable error messages or fallback UI to inform users of issues and guide recovery.

## 4. Handle Convex and Clerk Errors Gracefully [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Integrate error handling for Convex and Clerk services to manage authentication and backend errors.
### Details:
Capture and interpret errors from Convex and Clerk APIs, mapping them to user-friendly messages and handling edge cases such as authentication failures or network issues.

## 5. Document Validation and Error Handling Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation outlining the validation and error handling approaches used throughout the application.
### Details:
Document the validation schemas, error boundary usage, error message formats, and handling strategies for third-party services. Include examples and guidelines for future development.
