# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Security and Performance Best Practices
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Apply security and performance best practices to the application.
# Details:
Secure API endpoints and database queries. Implement rate limiting and input sanitization. Optimize data fetching and rendering. Use Next.js ISR or SSG where appropriate. Monitor for common security vulnerabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Test for common security issues (XSS, CSRF, etc.). Verify performance metrics (load time, responsiveness).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement API Authentication and Authorization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
### Details:
Implement TLS encryption for all API communications. Set up OAuth2 with OpenID Connect for single sign-on capabilities. Create an API key system for programmatic access. Follow the principle of least privilege for all authorization rules. Document the authentication flow for developers.

## 2. Implement Input Validation and Sanitization [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all API endpoints and database queries to prevent injection attacks.
### Details:
Use libraries like express-validator for input validation. Implement schema validation to verify data structure and size. Sanitize all user inputs before processing. Create parameterized queries for database operations. Validate both client-side and server-side inputs.

## 3. Implement Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Set up rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to protect API endpoints from abuse and DDoS attacks.
### Details:
Implement IP-based rate limiting to restrict requests within specific timeframes. Set up content delivery networks to distribute traffic load. Configure appropriate rate limits for different API endpoints based on their resource requirements. Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts.

## 4. Optimize Data Fetching with Next.js ISR/SSG [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement Next.js Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) for appropriate pages to improve performance.
### Details:
Identify pages suitable for static generation. Implement ISR with appropriate revalidation intervals for semi-dynamic content. Use getStaticProps and getStaticPaths for fully static pages. Implement proper caching strategies. Minimize client-side data fetching where possible.

## 5. Set Up Security Monitoring and Vulnerability Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3
### Description: Implement continuous security monitoring and regular vulnerability scanning to identify and address security issues.
### Details:
Set up an API gateway to centralize security controls and monitoring. Implement logging for all security-related events. Configure alerts for suspicious activities. Perform regular dependency vulnerability scans. Limit data exposure by returning only necessary information from API endpoints. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
