## Core Strategy Mechanics for Consistent Income

The wheel strategy operates as a systematic three-phase cycle designed to generate multiple income streams while potentially acquiring quality stocks at discounted prices. Each phase serves a specific purpose in the overall income generation framework.

### Phase 1: Cash-Secured Puts

Phase 1 begins with selling cash-secured puts on stocks you're willing to own. When you sell a put option, you collect premium income upfront while setting aside cash equal to 100 shares multiplied by the strike price. For a $100 stock, this means reserving $10,000 per contract. If the stock stays above your strike price at expiration, you keep the entire premium and repeat the process. Historical data shows approximately 70-80% of puts expire worthless, allowing you to collect income without ever owning the stock.

### Phase 2: Stock Assignment

Phase 2 occurs when stocks are assigned to you at the put strike price. This typically happens when the stock price falls below your strike at expiration. While assignment might seem negative, you've actually acquired shares at a discount equal to the premium collected. For example, selling a $95 put for $2 means your effective purchase price is $93, even though the strike was $95. During this ownership phase, you collect any dividends the stock pays.

### Phase 3: Covered Calls

Phase 3 involves selling covered calls against your stock position. You select a strike price above your cost basis and collect additional premium. If the stock rises above the call strike, your shares are "called away" and you return to Phase 1 with cash. This completes the wheel cycle. The strategy generates income through four sources: put premiums, call premiums, dividends, and potential capital gains when shares are called away.

## Stock Selection Criteria and Position Sizing

Successful wheel implementation requires disciplined stock selection focusing on quality, liquidity, and appropriate volatility characteristics. For a $150,000 portfolio, target 8-12 positions with individual allocations between 5-10% per stock.

## Implementation Plan from Start to Finish

Executing the wheel strategy requires systematic processes for each phase, with specific criteria guiding every decision. Professional research indicates 30-45 days to expiration (DTE) provides optimal risk-adjusted returns across market conditions.

### Initial Put Selling Process
1. **Strike Selection**: Target 0.15-0.30 delta (15-30% probability of assignment)
2. **Price Targeting**: Strikes 5-15% below current market prices
3. **Premium Goals**: Aim for 1-3% of capital at risk per trade
4. **Order Entry**: Use "Sell to Open" limit orders at or slightly below mid-market

### Assignment Handling Procedures
1. **Cost Basis Calculation**: Strike price minus premium received
2. **Technical Analysis**: Review support/resistance levels
3. **Market Assessment**: Evaluate current conditions before next move
4. **Covered Call Preparation**: Select appropriate strikes above breakeven

### Covered Call Implementation
1. **Delta Targeting**: Similar 0.15-0.30 delta range
2. **Strike Selection**: Above breakeven price when possible
3. **Expiration Coordination**: Align with dividend schedules
4. **Premium Objectives**: 1-2% of stock value per cycle

### Rolling Strategies
- **Put Rolls**: Roll to later expirations maintaining net credit
- **Roll Limits**: Maximum 2-3 rolls before assignment or loss
- **Call Rolls**: Move up and out when possible, always for net credit
- **Net Credit Rule**: Never roll for a debit
