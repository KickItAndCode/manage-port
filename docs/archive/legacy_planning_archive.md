## Legacy Planning Archive

This note captures the previous planning artifacts that lived in the removed `tasks/` directory (e.g., `tasks.json`, `task_00x.txt`, and the related per-feature plans). It serves as a reference so we can trace earlier priorities even though we have reset the working roadmap.

### Historical Focus Areas
- **Foundation & Core CRUD (Tasks 1–5)**: Repo setup, Convex/Clerk integration, property CRUD flows, and the initial dashboard metrics.
- **Utilities & Lease Infrastructure (Tasks 6–10)**: Convex schemas plus UI for utilities and leases, culminating in the property details page that stitched those entities together.
- **Quality & Platform Health (Tasks 11–15)**: Validation, security/perf best practices, navigation fixes, and responsive shell improvements.
- **Backlog of UX/Feature Enhancements (Tasks 16–29)**:
  - Document management implementation and design-system standardization
  - Responsive tables, quick actions, notifications, advanced search
  - Property wizard, analytics, loading/error polish, activity timelines
  - Bulk operations, status badges, and a large set of lease UI upgrades (cards, filters, inline edits, etc.)

### Why We Archived It
The legacy plan grew complex and task-heavy, making it harder to focus on the new product goals: a simpler experience, unified components, and clearer utility tracking. The upcoming roadmap in `docs/NEXT_PHASE_PLAN.md` re-centers the work around those objectives while incorporating the most impactful legacy ideas.
