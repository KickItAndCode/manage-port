# Playwright Next Steps - Action Plan

## 🚀 Immediate Actions (Do These First)

### 1️⃣ **Test Basic Setup (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Make sure your dev server is running in one terminal:
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run the smoke test:
npm run test:smoke

# This will verify Playwright can access your app
```

### 2️⃣ **Set Up Test User in Clerk (10 minutes)**
1. Go to your Clerk Dashboard
2. Create a test user with known credentials
3. Create `.env.test` file:
```bash
cp .env.test.example .env.test
# Edit .env.test with your test credentials
```

### 3️⃣ **Test Authentication Flow (15 minutes)**
```bash
# Run auth setup test in headed mode to see what's happening
npx playwright test auth.setup.ts --headed --project=chromium

# If it fails, use debug mode to step through:
npx playwright test auth.setup.ts --debug
```

### 4️⃣ **Run Full Test Suite (20 minutes)**
```bash
# Once auth works, run all tests
npm test

# Or use UI mode for better visibility
npm run test:ui
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: Clerk Sign-in Form Not Found**
```typescript
// Solution: Use Playwright Inspector to find correct selectors
npx playwright codegen localhost:3000/sign-in

// This opens a browser where you can interact with your app
// and it generates the correct selectors for you
```

### **Issue: Tests Timeout Waiting for Elements**
```typescript
// Solution: Add explicit waits and better selectors
// Update your components to include data-testid attributes:

// In your React components:
<Button data-testid="add-property-btn">Add Property</Button>

// In your tests:
await page.click('[data-testid="add-property-btn"]');
```

### **Issue: Authentication Fails**
```bash
# Solution 1: Use Clerk's test mode
# Add to your .env.test:
CLERK_TESTING_MODE=true

# Solution 2: Mock authentication for UI-only tests
# Create a separate config without auth:
npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.no-auth.ts
```

## 📋 Complete Setup Checklist

- [ ] Dev server runs successfully (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Smoke test passes (`npm run test:smoke`)
- [ ] Test user created in Clerk Dashboard
- [ ] `.env.test` file created with credentials
- [ ] Authentication test works (`npx playwright test auth.setup.ts`)
- [ ] At least one full test passes
- [ ] UI test mode works (`npm run test:ui`)

## 🎯 Progressive Testing Strategy

### **Phase 1: Get One Test Working (Today)**
1. Focus on smoke test first
2. Get authentication working
3. Run one simple dashboard test

### **Phase 2: Critical Path Tests (This Week)**
1. Property creation workflow
2. Lease management basics
3. Navigation between pages

### **Phase 3: Full Coverage (Next Week)**
1. Utility bill workflows
2. Payment processing
3. Edge cases and error handling

## 🛠 Debugging Commands

```bash
# See what Playwright sees
npx playwright test --headed

# Step through test line by line
npx playwright test --debug

# Record new test interactions
npx playwright codegen localhost:3000

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test dashboard.spec.ts

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Generate test report
npm run test:report
```

## 📝 Quick Test to Verify Everything Works

Create this simple test file to verify your setup:

```typescript
// tests/verify-setup.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('verify playwright setup', async ({ page }) => {
  // Just check the app loads
  await page.goto('/');
  
  // Take a screenshot for debugging
  await page.screenshot({ path: 'test-results/homepage.png' });
  
  // Check page loaded
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

Run it with:
```bash
npx playwright test verify-setup.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know Playwright is working when:
1. ✅ Smoke test passes without errors
2. ✅ You can see browser windows opening (in headed mode)
3. ✅ Test report shows passed tests
4. ✅ Screenshots appear in test-results folder
5. ✅ UI test mode shows your tests visually

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. Check the error message carefully
2. Use `--debug` flag to step through the test
3. Use `npx playwright codegen` to record correct selectors
4. Check test-results folder for screenshots
5. Simplify - get one basic test working first

## 🎉 Once It's Working

When you have tests running successfully:
1. Add `data-testid` attributes to key UI elements
2. Expand test coverage for critical workflows
3. Set up CI/CD to run tests automatically
4. Add visual regression tests for UI consistency

Start with Step 1 and work through progressively. Most issues are related to:
- Clerk authentication selectors
- Timing (elements not loaded yet)
- Incorrect URLs or ports

The key is to start simple and build up! 🚀
